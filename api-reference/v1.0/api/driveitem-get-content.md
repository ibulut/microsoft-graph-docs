## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/content
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /me/drive/root:/{item-path}:/content
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /sites/{siteId}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /users/{userId}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

## Optional request headers

| Name          | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | String | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Example

Here is an example to download a complete file.


<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "download-item-content", "scopes": "files.read" } -->

```http
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

### Response

Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the file.
This is the same URL available through the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property on the DriveItem.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immediately.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
```

## Partial range downloads

To download a partial range of bytes from the file, your app can use the `Range` header as specified in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). 
Note that you must append the `Range` header to the actual `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` URL and not to the request for `/content`.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "opaqueUrl": true, "name": "download-item-partial", "scopes": "files.read" } -->

```http
GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

This will return an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request range of bytes from the file.
If the range cannot be generated the Range header may be ignored and an `HTTP 200` response would be returned with the full contents of the file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "name": "download-item-partial", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<first 1024 bytes of file>
```
