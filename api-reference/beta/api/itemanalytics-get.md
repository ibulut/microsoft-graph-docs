# Get analytics

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

For a custom time range or interval, use the [getActivitiesByInterval][] API.

>**Note:** The **itemAnalytics** resource is not yet available in all [national deployments](/graph/deployments).

[itemAnalytics]: ../resources/itemanalytics.md
[getActivitiesByInterval]: ../api/itemactivity-getbyinterval.md
